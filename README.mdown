# SalesKing CSV Importer

A SalesKing app to import csv files. As a starting point you can import
clients given as csv f.ex exported from Outlook.

## Developer Infos

The app is build with Rails 3.1 on Ruby 1.9.2 and a mysql & postgres 
backend. It uses oAuth2 and has a canvas integration, so a user can use 
it inside SalesKing.

## Getting Started

1. Register a new app to get an app-id & secret in your SalesKing account.
DON'T forget to set it's canvas slug.

2. Checkout this repo, copy and edit salesking_app.yml & database.yml.

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake db:migrate
    bundle exec rails s

3. Go into SalesKing at /app/your-canvas-slug

## Run on Heroku

The app is deployed by us on Heroku and [you can do it too](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails31_heroku_cedar). The only problem to be 
solved is the creation of the salesking_app.yml keeping the app 
key & secret. 
Instead of using [Heroku's env_vars](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) you should use a separate 
local git branch where you add the ignored salesking_app.yml file:

    # create a new branch
    git checkout production
    [create salesking_app.yml, remove from .gitignore and commit]
    git merge master
    git push heroku production:master
    # change back to master branch for normal edits .. DON'T merge production into master
    git checkout master

DON'T FORGETT: never push production to your public branch, if you do you need to setup NEW app credentials


## Test

Run specs with

    bundle exec rake spec

Test coverage report is created by simpleCov and available after running the
specs
